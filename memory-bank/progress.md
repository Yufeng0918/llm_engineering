# Progress

This document tracks the current status of the LLM Engineering Workspace, what has been built, what remains, and known issues.

## What Works
- The basic directory structure is in place.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created.
- The environment supports Python development and Jupyter notebooks.

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive documentation of existing codebases (e.g., `week1` through `week8` directories, `community-contributions`).
- Integration of specific LLM tools and frameworks as per project requirements.
- Implementation of advanced features outlined in `projectbrief.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.

## Current Status
The project is in its initial setup phase, with foundational documentation being established. The primary goal is to create a well-documented and organized workspace for future LLM engineering tasks.

## Known Issues
- Lack of detailed documentation for existing code.
- No automated testing or CI/CD pipelines currently in place.
- Performance bottlenecks for large-scale LLM training may arise without dedicated hardware.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to implement a memory bank was made to ensure consistent context and knowledge transfer across sessions.
- Initial focus is on documentation and environment setup before deep-diving into feature development.
