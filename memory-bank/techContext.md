# Tech Context

This document details the technologies, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns within the LLM Engineering Workspace.

## Technologies Used
- **Primary Language:** Python (3.9+)
- **Core Libraries:**
    - `transformers`: For pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
    - `pytorch`/`tensorflow`: Deep learning frameworks.
    - `numpy`, `pandas`: Data manipulation.
    - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning utilities.
- **Notebook Environment:** JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook.
- **Version Control:** Git.

## Development Setup
- **Recommended OS:** macOS, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), Windows (WSL2).
- **Python Environment Management:** `conda` or `venv`.
- **Package Management:** `pip`.
- **IDE:** VS Code (with Python extensions, Jupyter extensions).

## Technical Constraints
- **Resource Limitations:** LLM training can be computationally intensive, requiring significant GPU resources.
- **Data Privacy:** Handling sensitive data requires adherence to privacy regulations.
- **Model Size:** Large models can be challenging to deploy and serve efficiently.

## Dependencies
- Refer to `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` for specific package dependencies.
- External LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face Hub) may require API keys and internet access.

## Tool Usage Patterns
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for interactive development, rapid prototyping, data exploration, and model experimentation.
- **Python Scripts:** Used for production-ready code, utility functions, and complex workflows.
- **Git:** For collaborative development, version control, and code sharing.
- **CLI Tools:** For environment setup, package installation, and script execution.
