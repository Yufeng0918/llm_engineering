# System Patterns

This document outlines the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths within the LLM Engineering Workspace.

## System Architecture
The workspace is primarily built around a modular Python-based architecture, utilizing Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and experimentation.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Python-centric:** Leverage Python's extensive data science and machine learning ecosystem.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Provide an interactive and reproducible environment for LLM development.
- **Modular Design:** Encourage reusability and maintainability through well-defined modules and functions.
- **Containerization (Future):** Consider Docker/Podman for consistent environments and easier deployment.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Modular Programming:** Breaking down the system into independent, interchangeable modules.
- **Configuration over Code:** Externalizing configurations to easily adapt to different LLM models or datasets.
- **Data-centric Design:** Focusing on efficient data handling, transformation, and storage for LLM training and inference.

## Component Relationships
- **Notebooks:** Interact with Python scripts and libraries for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scripts/Libraries:** Provide core functionalities and utilities, callable from notebooks or standalone.
- **Data Files:** Store datasets, fine-tuning examples, and model outputs.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **Data Preparation Pipelines:** Efficiently clean, preprocess, and format data for LLM training.
- **Model Training & Fine-tuning Workflows:** Streamlined processes for adapting LLMs to specific tasks.
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** Robust methods for assessing model performance and identifying biases.
- **Integration with LLM APIs:** Secure and efficient communication with external LLM services.
