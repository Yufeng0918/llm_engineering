# Product Context

This document explains the purpose of the LLM Engineering Workspace, the problems it solves, and how it aims to function.

## Why this project exists
The project exists to provide a standardized and efficient environment for developing, experimenting with, and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to reduce setup time and provide common tools for LLM engineering tasks.

## Problems it solves
- Inconsistent development environments for LLM projects.
- Lack of centralized tools for fine-tuning, data handling, and evaluation.
- Difficulty in sharing and collaborating on LLM-related code and experiments.

## How it should work
The workspace should be easy to set up and use, providing a clear structure for organizing LLM projects. It should offer a robust set of pre-configured tools and libraries relevant to LLM development.

## User experience goals
- **Ease of Use:** Users should be able to quickly start new LLM projects without extensive configuration.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlined workflows for common LLM engineering tasks.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitate sharing of code and results among users.
- **Extensibility:** Allow users to easily integrate new tools and frameworks.
